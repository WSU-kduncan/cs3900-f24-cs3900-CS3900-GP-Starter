interviewer — 
Hello, my name is Lydia Clark and I'm working with a group to create an application for managing restaurant orders. I have a few questions prepared for you to answer honestly. We'll be using your answers to improve our product so please answer truthfully
First question: why do you want an application?

R. James — 
Hello, I'm Richard James and I'm looking for an application to make it easier to manage the orders at my restaurant. It's gotten out of hand and I'm losing profits to mixed up and lost orders.

interviewer — 
Thanks for taking the time to attend the interview. Next question, how comfortable are you with applications and technology?

R. James —
I have an iPhone I use everyday, but I can't recall the last time I sat down at a computer. I would say I'm moderately familiar with tech, but aside from apps on my phone I haven't used many.

interviewer —
ok, that's perfectly fine. next question, who in your business is going to be using this application?

R. James —
The manager and probably the host who is in charge of seating people that night. The servers can probably just relay their information to the host. I'm not entirely sure what would be the most efficient. 

interviewer —
ok, that can be something we'll keep in mind. next question: What have you tried in the past to manage orders?

R. James —
We've used paper tickets and we tried a management system in the past.

interviewer —
okay, tell me more about those? why didn't they work out?

R. James —
The management system was too overwhelming for me and the staff. It had too many options and buttons and we messed up more than the paper tickets. The paper tickets just get lost or mixed up in order too much.

interviewer —
That makes sense, and what are you all using currently?

R. James —
Back to the paper tickets, it's what we are familiar with and though frustrating it's our best option at the moment.

interviewer —
makes sense. how long ago did you go back to using the paper tickets?

R. James —
We tried the management system a few years ago, so... Since 2021? But we used them before that too.

interviewer —
That's a pretty long time. how effective would you say the paper ticket system is?

R. James —
We manage most nights, but the errors really get frustrating. I know we are losing money to lost tickets or things taking too long. So, it's useable, but not very effective.

interviewer —
I can imagine how annoying that must be. How many orders do you take in a day?

R. James —
I would say between one hundred to one hundred and twenty five on weekdays and closer to two hundred on the weekends.

interviewer —
Goodness, no wonder you're struggling with the paper tickets! What kind of issues do you have with coordinating between your staff members on those days?

R. James —
I mentioned the ticket mix-ups, sometimes the servers lose a ticket, or the cooks can't read their handwriting. This leads to us falling behind or losing a table.

interviewer —
Can you think of any specific examples that really frustrated you?

R. James —
Just the other night we had a table come in and inform the waitress of a food allergy. Well, the cook either didn't see it, or couldn't read it and we almost had an emergency. Thankfully the customer noticed first, I felt terrible.

interviewer —
Thats really really bad! I'm glad the customer noticed it in time because that could've gotten you in a lot of trouble. 
So for an application like this, what are some features that you think you would prioritize or use the most?

R. James —
Really just keeping it simple. I would like to be able to search past orders in case the register doesnt add up one night. Or remove an order if a table has to leave for some reason. 

interviewer —
great, those are definitely features that we're planning on prioritizing. So, would you be interested in receiving an alert for low-stocked items or pending orders? how would you want to receive those?

R. James —
An alert for pending orders would be great, especially if they've been sitting a while. A table getting lost and being forced to wait a long time is a huge concern.

interviewer —
Okay, we can see about a notification system. What kind of devices do you and your staff have available to you?

R. James —
We have a desktop computer in the office and a second one at the host stand. I'm sure everyone has smart phones too, I use mine frequently.

interviewer —
Probably, and that'll be very helpful for an alert system. One final question: Do you have any existing apps or platforms that you already use that may benefit from integration from our app?

R. James —
No we don't. We've only tried the one system before and it was too confusing. Just paper tickets.

interviewer —
Perfect, thanks again for helping us out with our interview, I hope you're looking forward to our app!

R. James —
Thank you for having me, i'm excited to see it when it's done.
