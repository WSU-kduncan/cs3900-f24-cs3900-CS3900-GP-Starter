> Q:  Hello! My name is Robert Sanders and I'm here to interview you about an application we are looking to develop. First things first, why do you want an application?

A:  It is a much easier way to do business compared to pen and paper.

> Q:  I can definitely agree there, that being said how familiar are you with computers and applications?

A:  Enough to get by but nothing advanced.

> Q:  Completely understandable. If you do adopt our system, who is going to be using this application?

A:  Myself and the servers.

> Q:  Great! You mentioned pen and paper, what all solutions have you tried in the past?

A:  Pen and paper as mentioned before. We also tried using excel and google sheets but there was very little success with these methods.

> Q:  I see, and why did those methods not work out?

A:  Paper and pen became too messy with all of the papers lying around and not all of the servers were used to using digital solutions.

> Q:  It can definitely be quite the jump. What are you currently using to manage orders then?

A:  A hybrid of pen and paper as well as excel.

> Q:  You mentioned the servers struggling a bit. How long have you been using this setup?

A:  About 6 and a half months.

> Q:  I see, not that long of a timeframe. How effective would you say using a hybrid setup of paper and excel is for you?

A:  It worked ok for the first few weeks and then it started to go downhill quickly.

> Q:  How many orders do you typically take in a day? Perhaps an increase in business could explain the difficulties.

A:  Any where from 20 - 40ish.

> Q:  I can definitely understand troubles with pen and paper with that amount. A related question, what challenges do you face with coordinating between different staff members?

A:  Simple things like communication issues, incorrect orders being entered, things of that nature.

> Q:  Have you had any recent examples of an order miscommunication/mishap that you're willing to share and what happened with it?

A:  We have issues where we have to comp orders of groups due to incorrect orders which leads to long wait times.

> Q:  That is definitely a quick way to lose profit. What specific features or functionalities would you use most in an application for food orders? (edited)

A:  Ease of use, and a way to track how long an order has been sitting in the queue.

> Q:  That could definitely help wait times! Would you like to receive feedback or alerts for things like low stock items or pending orders, and how?

A:  Yes, and by a notification in the app.

> Q:  Excellent, speaking of notifications. What devices are most accessible to you and your staff?

A:  Tablets, phones and computer.

> Q:  It would definitely be convenient to track orders by phone. Thank you for coming to the interview, just one last question. Do you want or need integration with existing software or platforms?

A:  No, I want to just start over from scratch

> Q:  Thats perfectly understandable. Thank you for the responses, your feedback will be used to improve our product.
