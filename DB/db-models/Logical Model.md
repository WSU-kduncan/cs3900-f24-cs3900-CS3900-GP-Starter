**Description:**

The Pet Adoption and Management System ERD provides a clear and straightforward picture of how the system works, making it easy for anyone—developers,
staff, or managers—to understand.
It shows how different parts of the system are connected: adopters apply to adopt pets, each application is for a specific pet, and shelter staff manage the pets. 
By laying out these relationships simply, the ERD helps everyone get on the same page about how the system is organized and how it should function, supporting better planning, communication, and development.
