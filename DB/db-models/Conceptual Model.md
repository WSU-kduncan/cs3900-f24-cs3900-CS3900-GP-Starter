**Description:**


Pet: Represents pets available for adoption, with attributes like Name, Species, and Status to manage their adoption status.

Adopter: Represents potential adopters with details like Name and Contact Information to manage communication.

Adoption Application: Connects adopters to pets they are interested in adopting, tracking the process with attributes like Application Date and Status.

Shelter Staff: Represents staff who manage the pets and applications, with attributes like Name and Position.

Relationships define the workflow: Adopters submit Applications for pets, and Shelter Staff manage these pets and applications. This structure helps everyone involved understand how the system operates and ensures smooth communication and processes.
