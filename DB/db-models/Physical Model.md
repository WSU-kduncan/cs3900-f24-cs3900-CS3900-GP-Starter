**Description**


The diagram includes several key entities: Pets, Adoption Applications, Staff, Adopters, and Inventory, each with specific attributes. Pets have fields like Pet_ID, Name, Species, and Status, while Adoption Applications track adoption details with Application_ID, Pet_ID, Adopter_ID, and Status. Staff and Adopters entities manage their respective information like Staff_ID, First_Name, and Phone_Number, and Adopter_ID, Name, and Email. The Inventory entity tracks items with Item_ID, Quantity, and Cost. These entities are connected through one-to-many relationships, showing how a pet can have multiple applications, and staff or adopters can handle multiple applications. The diagram effectively maps these relationships, illustrating how the systemâ€™s data flows and interacts across entities.
