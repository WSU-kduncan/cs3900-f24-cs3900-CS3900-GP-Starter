## Conceptual Model
![Conceptual Model for OrderMaster DB](CS3900_OrderMaster_Conceptual.png)

The conceptual model for the OrderMaster database lays out a simple, easy-to-understand diagram of the database's entities, their relationships among themselves, and their attributes. This allows any individual to follow the database's flow, regardless of their experience level.

#### **menu_items**

The menu_items entity is a representation of individual items present on the restaurant's menu. This entity is used to populate the order_details entity so that the items for an order are neatly stored.

## **Logical Model**

The logical model defines the structure of the database in more detail. It includes entities, their attributes, primary and foreign keys, and relationships between the entities. 

---
## **Physical Model**

![Physical Model for OrderMaster DB](CS3900_OrderMaster_Physical.png)

The physical model of the restaurant orders database defines the detailed structure of the tables, their attributes, and relationships. It is optimized for a MariaDB environment and includes specific data types and constraints such as `IDENTITY`, `NOT NULL`, and foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity.

---

### **Tables**

Represents the restaurantâ€™s seating arrangement.

| Attribute   | Data Type    | Description                                  |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **table_id** | `INT`         | Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each table. Primary key. |
| **capacity** | `TINYINT`     | Defines the number of seats available at each table. Not null. |

- **Relationships**: One-to-one relationship with `food_orders`: Each table is linked to one food order at a time.
