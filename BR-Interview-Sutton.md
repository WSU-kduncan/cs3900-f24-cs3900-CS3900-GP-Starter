> Q - So, who do you envision using this application on a day-to-day basis?

A - The primary users will be the servers, kitchen staff, and front desk personnel. Managers will also use it to track performance, inventory, and generate reports. Everyone from the front-of-house to the back-of-house will be interacting with the system.

> Q - How busy would you say your restaurant typically gets? How many orders do you handle during an average day?

A - On average, we process about 150-200 orders daily, especially during peak hours like lunch and dinner. This includes sit-down orders, delivery, and takeout.

> Q - That’s quite a lot of orders! How are you currently managing them?

A - We currently use a manual system: paper tickets for the kitchen and handwritten notes to track tables and orders. It's functional but prone to human error.

> Q - What is it about your current system that makes you want to move to an application-based solution?

A - We need to streamline operations. The manual system leads to mistakes and delays, especially during rush hours. An application will help us track orders more efficiently, avoid errors, and save time. Plus, it will make our restaurant run smoother overall.

> Q - Have you tried any other solutions in the past? If so, what’s your experience been like?

A - We tried a basic POS system a few years ago, but it was too complicated for our team, and the training process was long and frustrating.

> Q - What do you think made those systems difficult to use?

A - The POS system required too much customization and training. It was also expensive, and in the end, the complexity outweighed the benefits. It didn't suit our small-to-medium sized restaurant workflow.

> Q - What are you currently using to manage orders?

A - As mentioned, we use a paper-based ticketing system. Each server writes down orders, passes them to the kitchen, and we rely on the staff to keep track of progress. It works, but there’s plenty of room for improvement.

> Q - What challenges do you face with coordinating between different staff members?

A - One of the biggest challenges is miscommunication between servers and the kitchen, especially when things get busy. Orders sometimes get misplaced or aren’t completed in the right order, leading to delays and frustrated customers.

> Q - Do you have any examples of an order miscommunication or mishap that you're willing to share? What happened?

A - Yes, just last week, a customer ordered a meal with specific dietary requirements (no gluten), but the server forgot to note that on the ticket. The kitchen made the dish with gluten, and we didn’t realize the mistake until the customer complained. We had to remake the order and comp the meal, which caused delays for other tables.

> Q - How effective is your current system at tracking orders?

A - It’s not very effective. Orders sometimes get lost, and it’s hard to follow up on which stage an order is in. We have no clear system to track completed versus pending orders.

> Q - What have you done in the past to track orders?

A - In the past, we’ve just kept track of orders manually with paper tickets and a whiteboard. It's basic, but once we got busier, it stopped being efficient, especially when we need to find details about a past order.

> Q - What devices are most accessible to you as a business?

A - We have tablets, smartphones, and desktop computers. Ideally, we would want the system to work across all these devices so staff can update orders and view information in real-time, wherever they are.

> Q - What specific features or functionalities would you prioritize in this system?

A - I’d prioritize:

- Real-time order tracking.
- Notifications for order status updates.
- Searchability of completed and pending orders.
- The ability to add special instructions (e.g., dietary requirements).
- Integration with inventory tracking, so we know when stock is low.
- Easy-to-use interface for all staff members.

> Q - Do you anticipate the need for any integrations with existing software or platforms?

A - Yes, it would be helpful to integrate with our accounting software for easier invoicing and payroll. In the future, integrating with third-party delivery services could also be useful.

> Q - How would you prefer to receive feedback or alerts for things like low stock items or pending orders?

A - Ideally, I’d want push notifications sent to the manager’s device and kitchen staff’s tablets. A dashboard with alerts for pending orders or low stock would also help us manage things more efficiently in real-time.
