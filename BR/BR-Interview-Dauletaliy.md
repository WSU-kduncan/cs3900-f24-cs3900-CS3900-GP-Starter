Hello my team and I are here to design an app that we think you would be interested in. May I ask a few questions? 

	`Yes.`

How big is your shelter?

	`Our shelter, I would consider it on the medium scale. when we don't have enough space for animals, we'll try to go to any sister shelters or just any volunteer places that are willing to take animals.`

Okay, how many staff members do you have at your shelter? 

	`So we have around, I would say like 30-ish employees, but a couple of them are volunteer. And we do tend to rotate out a lot because taking care of pets is a really big responsibility. And we want to make sure that everybody is well-trained and well-equipped and ready to do that. equipped and ready to do that.`

How many applications do you get per month?

	`it really depends on what time it is, because around the holidays, our adoptions do shoot up drastically. I would say during the summertime, we get anywhere to 10 to 15 adoptions a month.`

How good is your team with technology?

	`We have a few older people who do struggle a bit with technology, but we do have a couple of really nice, willing employees who tend to help and be more tech savvy. We are currently trying to focus on going all digital, but like I said, there are a few things that are kept pen and paper.` 

Okay, what is your current system for managing the adoptions? 

	`Just like my parents before me, pen and paper with some excel sheets and all. We actually have a whole archive of books.` 

What about other management tools? Do you have trouble with them? 

	`We have had a bit of trouble with physical management items because there are issues with it, such as it gets destroyed somehow or it gets lost and whatnot. And so we are hoping to have one unified method of storing things. And we have tried a few online apps. It's just a lot of them are paid subscription, which is hard for us because we prefer to keep all our resources towards the pets themselves. And then also a lot of them have features that are unnecessary or they're too complicated for our simple means. means.`

Okay, and what animals do you have up for adoption? 

	`So we normally have just cats and dogs. Any other exotic animals such as lizards, birds, or even bunnies, we give out to any other location who is more well-equipped to handle that.`	

Awesome. How do you prioritize which pets to promote or feature for adoption?

	`friends and family pets are normally put for adoptions while the others arent because we like to train the animals that are less friendly first before they're ready for homes.`

What challenges do you face with keeping information up to date on pets?

	`So when we have influxes of pets, it's really hard to keep track of who needs what. So if, for example, there is a medical issue, a temporary medical issue with a pet, we need to keep strict eyes on them to make sure that they get any care they need at that time. And just due to the fickle nature of health, it's hard to keep track of it all at once. nature of health, it's hard to keep track of it all at once.` 

What is your customer base?

	`Normally it's like families who are looking to adopt pets. Occasionally we'll get a few young adults who want to have some kind of pet. 
usually it's like a couple or a mom and dad who are looking to get pets.`

How do you currently communicate with potential adopters?

	`Currently, our main form of communication is through numbers or social media, but we have had to communicate through solely email before.` 

What happens after an applicant gets approved?

	`If an applicant gets approved, we'll have them meet with the dog or cat that they want. And if they fill out all the necessary paperwork, we will get them situated with any needed supplies they need. And we'll send the dog home. We'll make sure they have our number at all times, though, if they have some kind of issue they need. And at the end of the first week, we will check in with them to see if there are any issues or if they're good to continue having the pet. need and at the end of the first week we will check in with them to see if there are any issues or if they're good to continue having the pet.`

You stated a moment ago that you give supplies with the adopted pets. How do you keep track of that inventory? 

	`So currently we are just using a printed out table. We do want to go digital with it, but we've had many issues going digital with it.` 

What are some issues you are having at the shelter at the moment?

	`One big issue is that we have a lot of pets do get adopted quickly, but those who don't get adopted quickly 
with some kind of health issue. And so it's just really hard to get them into good homes because they do take up space and we do care for them a lot. It's just, it's hard to keep the same space instead of switching out animals constantly.` 
	
What are you hoping this app will help with? 

	`Help with adoption for interested people, show the different animals we have, and also just a really good place for our employees to file any paperwork needed and any notes. 
don't just make things a lot more centralized and make it easier for us to work more productively instead of having to use multiple different applications at once.` 

What features would you say would make managing your shelter easier?

	`Firstly, it would be amazing if we could have files on all the pets there are and be able to create any notes on any medical issues or just general things for them in general. We would also love to have some kind of communication system where we can easily share these files with each other. And also to have something that would help us manage what we have in store would be amazing. And also to have something that would help us manage what we have in store would be amazing.` 

Okay, thank you so much for your time, mrs. Dauletaliy. I appreciate this interview. 

	`No problem. Thank you for interviewing me. It's been a pleasure. 
forward to seeing what you create!` 

Thank you. Have a good day.
