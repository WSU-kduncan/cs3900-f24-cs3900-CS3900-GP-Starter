Hello, my team and I are creating an application that could possibly help an animal shelter like yours. What is your current system for managing adoptions? 
> I keep a file cabinet with everyone's records.

Okay, and how good is your team with technology?
> Since a lot of the workers are older, technology is harder to use.

What animals does your shelter have at the moment? Like what are your rescues?
> Cats, dogs, and mice.

Are there any issues that your shelter is having at the moment?
> We have too many mice.

How about organization or management wise?
> The employees lose track of records a lot.

What does your current customer base look like? 
> People who want cats, dogs, or mice.

Okay, now how big is your shelter? Is it smaller or fairly large?
> I'd say its about average, maybe on the larger side.

And how many staff members do you have?
> 42.

Say we are creating an app to help you manage your shelter in a more organized manner. What are you hoping this app could help you with?
> I hope this helps me manage my staff better, and I would like an application that could look up customers' information based on records.

Okay, roughly how many adoption applications would you say that you get per month? 
> Around 150. A lot of people want mice.

And what is your process after an applicant is approved to adopt one of your animals?
> We call the applicant and let them know they have been approved, and if they are still interested, they have one week to come pick up the animal, or we will move on to another applicant. 

Okay, so are there any other ways that you currently communicate with potential adopters? Other than over the phone?
> Email and our website.

How is inventory tracked at your shelter? 
> We have a large sheet of paper and require the manager on duty that week to make sure she takes the week to do inventory, it must be submitted every Friday.

Okay, what features could make that easier for you? Or make managing the shelter easier in general?
>  Being able to check off daily tasks and keep track of times people have worked.

Anything else? How about with keeping pet information up-to-date?
> If we could have an app similar to myChart, myCat per se, where you could manage each of your animals information, and if you have any concerns you could directly contact a vet to ask questions or make appointments and keep their physical records up to date.

Okay, that is all I have to ask you today, thank you for your time.
> Of course.
