## [Animal Shelter Pro]

### Context

Pet shelters need a better way to manage adoption applications, track inventory, and organize staff tasks. 

The Animal Shelter Pro app aims to solve these challenges by providing a simple, all-in-one platform.

### Use Cases

Emma has been working in animal rescue for over 10 years. Five years ago, she decided to start her own shelter. As the shelter grew, so did the workload. Emma found herself buried in administrative work. She no longer had the time to personally care for the animals, which was what she loved most about running the shelter.

When she first hired staff, Emma looked into software to help make managing the shelter easier. However, she quickly felt overwhelmed by all the complicated features. She decided to keep using spreadsheets and paper records because it felt easier at the time. But now, as more animals come in and adoption requests pile up, Emma struggles to keep track of everything. Animals are getting overlooked, adoption paperwork is getting lost, and coordinating foster placements feels like chaos.

Every day, Emma thinks to herself: “If there were only a simple software system that could help me manage the shelter without all the unnecessary features. Something user-friendly that lets me track which animals are in the shelter, who’s adopting them, where they’re being fostered, and what supplies we need—all in one place.”
