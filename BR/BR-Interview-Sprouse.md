# Interview Questions
## (1)How do you prioritize which pets to promote or feature for adoption?
	A: We typically try to show all our pets off equally but due to a lack of organization some end up being promoted more than others.

## (2)What is your current system for managing adoptions? 
	A: We are currently using pen and paper to track all the adoptions. However, our filing system is starting to get messy with the amount of applications we have.
	
## (3)How good is your team with technology?
	A: I'd say fairly good, about as good as anyone else who has a smartphone and has to use a computer. They definitely haven't been trained to use anything too complicated though.
## (4)What animals do you have up for adoption? 
	A: Your basic animals, Dogs, Cats, the ocassional Rabbit. Most other animals need special care so we try to avoid them. 
## (5)What are some issues you are having at the shelter at the moment?
	A: A lack of organization has led to a couple instances of two families being told they can adopt the same pet, We are also having an issue managing out inventory.
		we've had issues of ordering too much of one thing and too little of another due to inaccurate records of whats in the store room. 
## (6)What is your customer base?
	A: pretty much anyone who wants to adopt a pet. We deal mostly with families looking to get a family pet, or just generally anyone looking to adopt, We also have a handful of foster homes.
	
## (7)How big is your shelter? 
	A: We have a staff of about 5 or 6 people including myself. We manage a large number of pets between 2-4 pets per staff member. 
	
## (8)How many staff members do you have?
	A: 5 or 6 sometimes during the busy season well take on volunteers but we typically keep a small staff. 
	
## (9)What are you hoping this app will help you with?
	A: mainly help us with organizing and managing our adoption applications as well as the day to day required to manage a shelter. That means inventory tracking, 
	pet tracking, and helping me to make sure my staff isnt getting overworked at any one job. 
	
## (10)What about other management tools do you have trouble with?
	A: like I said earlier while my staff is about as tech savvy as anyone they haven't had any special training and so most management tools go over their heads and mine.
	
## 11)How many applications do you get per month?
	A: anywhere from 20 to 60 at our peak time. 
	
## (12)What happens after an applicant gets approved?
	A: after an applicant gets approved we set up a time for them to come into the shelter to pick up their pet. We will mark on the pets kennel that they have been given to a family	
	and then mark the application as complete.
	
## (13)How is Inventory tracked?
	A: the inventory room has shelves labeled with letters and then spaces on those shelves marked out in numbers. It used to help keep track of where everything was, 
	however lately its fallen in dissarray as weve struggled to keep the sorting method straight. A way for my workers to look up where something is would be a big help.
	
## (14)What features would make managing your shelter easier?
	A: some way to search for individual applications, and see what pets have been adopted would be very helpful . 
	
## (15)How do you currently communicate with potential adopters?
	A: at the moment they need to call or come in in person. 
	
## (16)What challenges do you face with keeping pet information up-to-date?
	A: like I said it was easier when we had fewer adoption applications and fewer pets to adopt but here lately were operating at capacity most of the time. 
		having to track all 40 animals on paper and all applications for each animal as well has started to get very difficult. Papers go missing, theres miscommunication and 
		no easy way to look up any information.
