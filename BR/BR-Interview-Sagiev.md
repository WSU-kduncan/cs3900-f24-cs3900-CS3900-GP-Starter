(1)How do you prioritize which pets to promote or feature for adoption?

    How long the pets were there, we don’t want pets to stay at the shelter forever. The pets that have been there longer get a higher level of prioritization. 

(2)What is your current system for managing adoptions?

    We have a little form and paper spreadsheet that keeps track of all the medical forms and pet information. 

(3)How good is your team with technology?

    Varies, some younger volunteers who know how to use technology. We also have older people don’t know how to use technology. 

(4)What animals do you have up for adoption?

    We have around 5 cats, 11 dogs and a bunny. 

(5)What are some issues you are having at the shelter at the moment?

    The process is too tedious to adopt an animal so it discourages a lot of people from adopting. If we were more digital it would make it easier to advertise the     animals

(6)What is your customer base?

    Usually small families with kids. 

(7)How big is your shelter?

    Max capacity is around 25 animals. 

(8)How many staff members do you have?

    4 staff members and 3 volunteers.

(9)What are you hoping this app will help you with?

    Help make management easier and make the adoption process easier. 

(10)What about other management tools do you have trouble with?

    Sometimes its hard to schedule and it's hard to keep track of finances. 

(11)How many applications do you get per month?

    Depends on the month, average is about 7 but two are usually bad so about 5. 

(12)What happens after an applicant gets approved?

    Based on the customer we try to match them with a pet, and try to get basic information from them such and income, housing, and why they want a pet

(13)How is Inventory tracked?

    A paper sheet that the shelter manager keeps track of everything. 

(14)What features would make managing your shelter easier?

    A centralized interface where we can manage all aspects, scheduling, inventory, applications, etc. 

(15)How do you currently communicate with potential adopters?

    We usually try to get their phone number and email. We try to meet in person at least once before the actual adoption. 

(16)What challenges do you face with keeping pet information up-to-date?

    It's hard to keep medical procedures up to date because every animal has different medications/treatments.
