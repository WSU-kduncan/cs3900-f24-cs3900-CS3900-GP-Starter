## Data Management

> Specify how user data will be collected, stored, and managed.     	

Our group will be utilizing an SQL database to store and manage user data, leveraging the relational structure of tables to represent entities like orders, menu items, and servers. Each table will be linked via primary and foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity. The frontend of our application will allow users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database, ensuring real-time access and manipulation of data. Data security will be a key focus, with role-based access controls and regular backups to safeguard against data loss or corruption.  Our group, as per the class' assignments, have already created a conceptual, logical, and finally a physical model as a visualization for the database. Databases such as these utilize tables, with individual tables representing entities in the database, the columns within representing the attributes of a row, and rows representing one instance of an entity. The goal is to create an application frontend that will allow our users to query and alter their own database instance to collect, store, and manage the data for their business.

## Feedback and Iteration

> Describe how user feedback will be collected and analyzed.

Our application will include a built-in feedback form that workers can freely utilize. We will periodically contact users directly to gather detailed insights. Feedback will be analyzed in group meetings, prioritized based on impact and feasibility, and then added to the development roadmap. Key metrics for feedback analysis will include user satisfaction, ease of use, and the frequency of reported issues. We will use agile development principles to iterate on the application, releasing regular updates that reflect user needs and suggestions.

## Future Features

> Provide a glimpse into potential features for future releases.

In future releases, we plan to add support for managing different types of food orders, such as delivery and takeout. We also aim to integrate features for menu management and staff scheduling. Long-term, we may integrate with third-party delivery services and accounting software to provide a seamless end-to-end solution. Additionally, the inclusion of reporting tools and analytics could help restaurant owners track key business metrics such as sales trends and order fulfillment times.

## Metrics for Success

> Define Key Performance indicators (KPIâ€™s) that will measure the success of the MVP.

As defined in the Analysis file, our KPIs are as follows:

Within the first 6 monnths:
- Reduce the amount of lost and incorrect food orders by 30% compared to paper tracking.
- Increase the speed of processing orders by 20%, measured by the average time taken to enter and fulfill an order in the system. 
- Ensure that 80% of users can pick up the application and use it effectively without training.
- Increase the overall effiectivness and create a better flow of communication between front and back of house.
