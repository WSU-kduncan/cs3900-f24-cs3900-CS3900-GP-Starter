## Data Management

> Specify how user data will be collected, stored, and managed.     	

Our group will be utilizing an SQL database to store data. Our group, as per the class' assignments, have already created a conceptual, logical, and finally a physical model as a visualization for the database. Databases such as these utilize tables, with individual tables representing entities in the database, the columns within representing the attributes of a row, and rows representing one instance of an entity. The goal is to create an application frontend that will allow our users to query and alter their own database instance to collect, store, and manage the data for their business.

```
Possible Change and explanation:

Our group will be utilizing an SQL database to store and manage user data, leveraging the relational structure of tables to represent entities like orders, menu items, and servers. Each table will be linked via primary and foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity. The frontend of our application will allow users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database, ensuring real-time access and manipulation of data. Data security will be a key focus, with role-based access controls and regular backups to safeguard against data loss or corruption.

**Why:** This provides more clarity on how the data will be stored and handled in real time, making the understanding of data management more comprehensive.
```

## Feedback and Iteration

> Describe how user feedback will be collected and analyzed.

Our intention is for the application to include a built-in feedback form that any worker can freely utilize. In addition, we plan to periodically contact our users directly over the course of development to gather feedback. Within a group meeting, we'll carefully examine each point, as well as the feedback as a whole, and discuss the best way to approach the changes. We'll add these changes to our development roadmap, and over the next few updates we will alter our program's design to accomodate the feedback as comprehensively as possible.

```
Possible Change and explanation:

Our application will include a built-in feedback form that workers can freely utilize. We will periodically contact users directly to gather detailed insights. Feedback will be analyzed in group meetings, prioritized based on impact and feasibility, and then added to the development roadmap. Key metrics for feedback analysis will include user satisfaction, ease of use, and the frequency of reported issues. We will use agile development principles to iterate on the application, releasing regular updates that reflect user needs and suggestions.

**Why:** This provides a clear strategy for prioritizing and implementing feedback, showing a structured and iterative approach.
```

## Future Features

> Provide a glimpse into potential features for future releases.

In the future, we hope to add functionality to manage different types of food orders, such as delivery or takeout. Long-term, we may consider adding features that will allow the program to manage other parts of the business, such as the menu.

```
Possible Change and explanation:

In future releases, we plan to add support for managing different types of food orders, such as delivery and takeout. We also aim to integrate features for menu management, staff scheduling, and even customer loyalty programs. Long-term, we may integrate with third-party delivery services and accounting software to provide a seamless end-to-end solution. Additionally, the inclusion of reporting tools and analytics could help restaurant owners track key business metrics such as sales trends and order fulfillment times.

**Why:** This shows forward-thinking planning and adds more detail on the potential growth of the application.
```

## Metrics for Success

> Define Key Performance indicators (KPI’s) that will measure the success of the MVP.

As defined in the Analysis file, our KPIs are as follows:
- Reduce the amount of lost and incorrect food orders by 30% compared to paper tracking.
- Increase the speed of filling out and locating food orders by 20% compared to paper tracking.
- Ensure that 80% of users can pick up the application and use it effectively without training.
- Increase the overall effiectivness and create a better flow of communication between front and back of house.

```
Possible Change and explanation:

Within the first six months of implementation, reduce the number of lost or incorrect food orders by 30% compared to paper tracking. Increase the speed of processing orders by 20%, measured by the average time taken to enter and fulfill an order in the system. Additionally, aim for 80% of users to navigate the application effectively without formal training, based on user satisfaction surveys and error tracking over the first three months.

**Why:** Adding a timeframe and specifying how you’ll measure these KPIs makes them more actionable and relevant.
