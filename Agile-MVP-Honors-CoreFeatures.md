## Data Management

> Specify how user data will be collected, stored, and managed.     	

Our group will be utilizing an SQL database to store data. Our group, as per the class' assignments, have already created a conceptual, logical, and finally a physical model as a visualization for the database. Databases such as these utilize tables, with individual tables representing entities in the database, the columns within representing the attributes of a row, and rows representing one instance of an entity. The goal is to create an application frontend that will allow our users to query and alter their own database instance to collect, store, and manage the data for their business.

## Feedback and Iteration

> Describe how user feedback will be collected and analyzed.

Our intention is for the application to include a built-in feedback form that any worker can freely utilize. In addition, we plan to periodically contact our users directly over the course of development to gather feedback. Within a group meeting, we'll carefully examine each point, as well as the feedback as a whole, and discuss the best way to approach the changes. We'll add these changes to our development roadmap, and over the next few updates we will alter our program's design to accomodate the feedback as comprehensively as possible.

## Future Features

> Provide a glimpse into potential features for future releases.

In the future, we hope to add functionality to manage different types of food orders, such as delivery or takeout. Long-term, we may consider adding features that will allow the program to manage other parts of the business, such as the menu.

## Metrics for Success

> Define Key Performance indicators (KPIâ€™s) that will measure the success of the MVP.

As defined in the Analysis file, our KPIs are as follows:
- Reduce the amount of lost and incorrect food orders by 30% compared to paper tracking.
- Increase the speed of filling out and locating food orders by 20% compared to paper tracking.
- Ensure that 80% of users can pick up the application and use it effectively without training.
