> Q - Hello, I am John Smith I'm here to ask you about an application we are looking to develop. First question, why do you want an application?

A -  Hi, my name is Lydia Clark, and I'm the owner of a small restaurant in Dayton, OH. I've been looking for an application that'll help my business keep track of our orders

> Q - Nice to meet you, how familiar are you with computers and applications?

A - I consider myself to be pretty familiar with computers. I have a PC at home and a phone, and i use them both for basic stuff like online shopping. im definitely not an expert, though

> Q - Who is going to be using this application?

A - I'm guessing that the restaurant's servers are going to use it the most, but most of my staff will probably use it

> Q - What challenges do you face with coordinating between different staff members?

A - well, we've recently been getting a lot of business, and during those busy days, its pretty common to see the servers bring food to the wrong tables, or to see items on an order get forgotten, or even to see one order being made more than once

> Q - You've mentioned the busy days but how many orders do you typically take in a day?

A - typically, we'll take around 80-90 in one day. on busy days its gone up to 200 before

> Q - Have you had any recent examples of an order miscommunication/mishap that you're willing to share and what happened?

A - sure! i mentioned before that, a month or so ago, we had an order that was somehow made twice. I guess the order was never put away after it was fulfilled, and the chefs didn't notice. It was pretty embarrassing for the server to bring food out to a table that was already eating. We redirected some of the items to other tables, but some of it had to be thrown away

> Q - Alright, we are about half way done, what solutions have you tried in the past?

A - we've only ever had one thing, its a POS system that I bought back when I first started the business

> Q - What reason did that solution not work out?

A - it works well enough, but it has a ton of minor annoyances that have been building up. Its very, very clunky and hard to use, so no one could figure out how it worked when we first opened. we eventually figured it out, but now every time I hire someone, we have to train them on this system. it's also given out a few times recently, which cost a decent amount of money to fix

> Q - What are you currently using to manage orders?

A - we're still using that same POS system. it's annoying, but it works

> Q - How long have you used your current system?

A - well, we opened up back in mid 2023, so around a year

> Q - How effective is your current system at tracking orders?

A - like i said, it still works fine. it's very, very feature-rich, so it can do basically anything, and once you learn to use it, it isnt so bad

> Q - What specific features or functionalities would you prioritize in this system (i.e., tracking inventory, generating reports)?

A - my biggest request is that it's easy to learn. I shouldn't have to train new hires on it. I also want it to run very quick and smooth, because the current one is pretty laggy at times. Other than that, i really just want a way to see if orders are completed or not

> Q - What devices are most accessible to you as a business?

A - the POS system we have is its own thing, so we never really got a centralized system for the restaurant. most of my servers have phones though, and i have a windows PC that i usually use for financial stuff that I might be able to use. I use an android but my servers use a mix of both

> Q - How would you prefer to receive feedback or alerts for things like low stock items or pending orders?

A - i think just a notification would do. i want to make sure that it makes a sound or at least vibrates, though, because i want to make sure my team knows when alerts go through

> Q - Final question, do you anticipate the need for any integration with existing software or platforms?

A - not really. it would be nice to be able to still use the old POS system, just so the tech doesnt go to waste, but i imagine that's not very reasonable
