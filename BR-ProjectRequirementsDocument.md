### Use Cases

As restaurants grow and handle more customers, the demand for efficiency in order management increases. In smaller restaurants, staff can manage orders manually without many issues. However, as the business scales, manual systems become more prone to errors such as misplaced orders, miscommunication between front and back of house, and long wait times for customers. These challenges can lead to lost revenue due to customer dissatisfaction and comped meals.

Restaurants that experience an increase in customer traffic often find themselves overwhelmed by the volume of orders, particularly during peak hours. Existing solutions on the market can be too complex or require significant training, which many small- to medium-sized restaurant teams are unable to accommodate. This results in a lack of adoption or inefficient usage of the system.

Managers are in search of a straightforward and user-friendly solution that allows their teams to quickly adapt and streamline the order process. Essential functionalities like creating and modifying orders, tracking when orders are placed, and searching completed orders for sales trends or discrepancies are crucial to ensuring smoother operations and reducing mistakes.

### Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop an intuitive order management system that allows restaurant staff to quickly and easily manage food orders, track the status of each order, and assign orders to tables and servers. By simplifying the process of order creation, modification, and tracking, the application will help reduce errors, increase operational efficiency, and enhance the overall customer experience.

Additionally, the application will:
- Improve communication between front-of-house and back-of-house staff.
- Provide transparency in order status to avoid delays or lost tickets.
- Allow for the modification of orders to reflect customer preferences and dietary restrictions.
