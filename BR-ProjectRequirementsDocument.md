### Use Cases

Richard Sanders opened his restaurant around 10 years ago. It started off quite small, with only a dozen or so customers each day. He was able to manage it with just himself and a small team of staff, 2 servers and 2 cooks. Since then the restaurant has grown slowly, but steadily and in his 5th year of operation he hired another server and a host to work the front stand. Things were going smoothly, the amount of tickets was never quite unmanagable and any errors were handled quickly. However, his restaurant exploded on social media in it's 7th year and he has had to expand quite a bit. Hiring another 3 servers and 2 more chefs. They lacked the rapport and communication that the team had before, and along with the massively increased order numbers, this has led to errors and lost orders piling up. Richard looked into software management systems and had little luck because the staff had no training and they were far too complex. The amount of tickets that get lost and customers that either leave, or have to get their food comped because of errors is cutting into profts.

Richard is frustrated and is constantly searching for a solution to his problem. "I just need a straightforward application that I can get my team used to quickly so we can get back on track. I really just need to be able to create orders and add details, like when they were placed. Oh, and the ability to search them in case theres a discrepancy or to check how items are selling."
