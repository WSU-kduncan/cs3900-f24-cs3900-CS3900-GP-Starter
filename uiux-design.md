**User Flow Description of Behavior**
The application behavior is as follows:
* When a user clicks "Select" next to an order, they are visually informed that the specific order is selected.
* Upon clicking "Delete," a confirmation modal ensures error prevention by asking for user verification.
* If confirmed, the order is removed from the list, with immediate feedback provided through a success message. This flow reduces user errors and enhances control.

1. **Start**
The user begins at the order management dashboard, where they see a list of current restaurant orders.
2. **View Orders**
The user reviews the list of orders displayed in rows, each with order details and actions.

3. **Select Order**
The user clicks the "Select" button next to the specific order they want to delete.

4. **Click Delete Button**
A "Delete" button appears below the list. The user clicks this button to initiate deletion.

5. **Confirmation Prompt**
A modal dialog appears, asking, "Are you sure you want to delete this order?" The user has two options:

   * Confirm: Deletes the order.
   * Cancel: Aborts the action and returns to the order list.

6. **Order Deleted**
If confirmed, the system deletes the selected order, which is removed from the list.

7. **Success Message**
A success message ("Order successfully deleted") appears, confirming the action.
