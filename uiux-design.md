**User Flow Description of Behavior**
The application behavior is as follows:

* When a user clicks "Select" next to an order, they are visually informed that the specific order is selected.
* Upon clicking "Delete," a confirmation modal ensures error prevention by asking for user verification.
* If confirmed, the order is removed from the list, with immediate feedback provided through a success message. This flow reduces user errors and enhances control.
